This is an example of using `FireBase` and React together.

* [Detailed Instructions](https://www.firebase.com/blog/2014-05-01-using-firebase-with-react.html)

This example uses the `FireBase` __explicit__ method (not mixins) and `throw-in-the-towel` - which is babel replacement that converts JSX inline.
